# What is the digital lending project? 

The digital lending project is an academic study of online loans sponsored by the University of Kentucky and conducted by [Michael McCanless](https://geography.as.uky.edu/users/mjmc273) and [Dr. Matthew Zook](https://geography.as.uky.edu/users/zook). As part of the study, we are aiming to speak with 20-25 people who have experience with online installment loans. We will be compensating participants $25 for one 30-60 minute interview. Personal installment loans are loans that can be used for any reason-- ranging from debt consolidation, to medical bills, to any other type of emergency expense. Think mortgages or auto loans, but for everyday expenses. As these lenders move their services online, new types of data are being used to assess a borrowers creditworthiness. This research wants to understand how borrowers are using personal installment loans and their motivations for going to online lenders. To sign up for the study, fill out the form below. All data collected from this form will be anonymized and cannot be traced back to you. If you have taken a loan from a lender that is issuing online installment loans, I will contact you at the phone number/email provided to set up a time and place for an interview (or conducted over the phone if social distancing measures are still in place).
