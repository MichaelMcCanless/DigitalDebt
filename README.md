# What is the digital lending project? 

This is the sign up for a research project sponsored by the University of Kentucky. The study is run by Michael McCanless and supervised by Dr. Matthew Zook. I am looking to speak with people who have experience taking out personal loans from online lenders. Personal loans are loans that are taken out and can be used for any reason-- ranging from credit card bills, to medical expenses, to cushioning a monthly budget. I will be paying participants $25 for 30-60 minutes of their time in an interview to be conducted online or over the phone. If you are interested, please fill out the form below. If you have taken a loan from an eligible lender, I will contact you at the phone number/email provided.
