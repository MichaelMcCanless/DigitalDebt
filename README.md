# What is the digital lending project? 

**Description**: The digital lending project is an academic study of online loans sponsored by the University of Kentucky and conducted by [Michael McCanless](https://geography.as.uky.edu/users/mjmc273) and [Dr. Matthew Zook](https://geography.as.uky.edu/users/zook). As lenders move their services online, new types of data are being used to assess a borrowers creditworthiness. This research wants to understand how borrowers are using personal installment loans and their motivations for going to online lenders. 

**Eligibility**: We are aiming to speak with 20-25 people who have experience using online personal installment loans. Personal installment loans are loans that can be used for any reason-- ranging from debt consolidation, to medical bills, to supplementing a monthly budget. Think mortgages or auto loans, but for everyday expenses. If you have used one of these loans from an online lender, we want to speak with you. 

**Compensation**: Participants will be compensated $25 for one 30-60 minute interview conducted online or over the phone. 

To sign up for the study, fill out the form below. All data collected from this form will be anonymized and cannot be traced back to you. If you have questions or concerns about participation in the study, feel free to contact me directly at michael.mccanless@uky.edu and I would be happy to provide more information.
